midform: SAM Animation is stop-motion animation software designed specifically for use in schools by students and teachers. Streaming a live camera image in from an external webcam, students manipulate objects, text, and other materials on a tabletop to assemble frame-by-frame animations. The software provides options for varying framerate (i.e., playback speeds) and simple editing tools, but the features are purposefully limited to focus students’ attention on the processes and ideas being animated, rather than the editing and polishing process. SAM Animation has been used to study students representational practices, science learning, and how different representational media support particular kinds of reasoning. (SAM Animation is distributed by iCreate to Educate).
