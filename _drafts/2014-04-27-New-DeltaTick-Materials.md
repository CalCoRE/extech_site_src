ExTech and the [Center for Connected Learning at Northwestern University](http://ccl.northwestern.edu) are happy to announce that the [DeltaTick Simulation Construction Toolkit](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/deltatick) is available for download! 

DeltaTick is a simulation construction toolkit that let students to construct their own computer simulations from customizable libraries of domain-specific, natural-language building blocks. We've used it to study how students make sense of connections between individual behavior and collective mathematical patterns in complex systems, especially in the domains of population biology and natural selection. 

For more information about DeltaTick, or to learn how to modify or create your own library, check out our [Tutorial Series](http://xxx). If you are a developer, you can also access the DeltaTick source code at [GitHub](http://xxx).
