ExTech and the [Center for Connected Learning at Northwestern University](http://ccl.northwestern.edu) are happy to announce that the [DeltaTick Simulation Construction Toolkit](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/deltatick) is available for download! 

DeltaTick is a simulation construction toolkit that let students to construct their own computer simulations from customizable libraries of domain-specific, natural-language building blocks. We've used it to study how students make sense of connections between individual behavior and collective mathematical patterns in complex systems, especially in the domains of population biology and natural selection. 

For more information about DeltaTick, or to learn how to modify or create your own library, check out our [Resource Page](http://bit.ly/MvI511), which includes a tutorial series, DeltaTick download page, video examples of use, and more. If you are a developer, you can also access the DeltaTick source code at [GitHub](http://http://bit.ly/DT_github).

DeltaTick was developed for research purposes, and is not as stable as commercial software. Before using DeltaTick for consequential tasks (research, presentations, classroom work, etc.) be sure to test it extensively. You are welcome to email us for more information, however, we work on DeltaTick in our free time and can't promise to address problems quickly.
