We are developing SiMSAM (Simulation, Measurement, and Stop Action Motion)&#58; a toolkit for middle school students to engage in scientific and mathematical modeling. SiMSAM enables students to construct animations, crop images from animations to become programmable simulation objects, measure patterns in simulations, and share creations. We share (1) the current design of the tool; (2) our design study methods, and (3) points of intersection and tension between LS/HCI interests as they manifest in our project.
