We are testing and polishing off the beta of SiMSAM, a fully web-enabled simulation, animation, and measurement toolkit for middle grades students to explore scientific modeling. Check out the screenshots here. We'll soon make SiMSAM available on the web, along with some sample activities and how-to videos.
