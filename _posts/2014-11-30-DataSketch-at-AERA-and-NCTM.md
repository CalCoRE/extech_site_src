abstract: Contemporary data visualizations blend mathematical, visual, and narrative elements to illustrate patterns of interest. But despite their increasing popularity in public and professional arenas, still little is known about how young people make sense of data visualizations. I bring together theories from the data sciences and conceptual resources literatures to explore data visualization literacy as individual and social coordination of mathematical, representational, and domain knowledge. I use this framework to analyze data from a two week middle school enactment in which seventh-graders at a diverse, urban public school designed visualizations of public city data. Using representative case studies, I show that the framework provides traction in explaining why some groups flourish while others reach impasse, and highlights possible resolutions. <br><br>A researcher and teacher at a diverse urban school partnered to enact a unit where 7th graders analyzed and designed visualizations of public city data. We analyze students' engagement with math content and mathematical agency, and identify supports that promoted mathematical depth. The talk will include classroom video and student work.

We'll share early classroom activities from the DataSketch project at NCTM 2015 in Boston, and some theoretical development around how to study and describe data visualization competencies at AERA 2015 in Chicago.
