midform: DeltaTick is a computational toolkit that enables students to construct their own computer simulations from customizable libraries of domain-specific, natural-language building blocks. We've used it to study how students make sense of connections between individual behavior and collective mathematical patterns in complex systems, especially in the domains of population biology and natural selection.
