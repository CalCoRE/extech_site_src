abstract: We are developing SiMSAM (Simulation, Measurement, and Stop Action Motion)&#58; an integrated toolkit for middle school science. SiMSAM will enable students to construct animations, 'crop' images from those animations to use as programmable simulation objects, measure patterns in simulations, and share creations. We present (1) analyses of video data from a pilot design studio focusing on patterns in students' representational choices, scientific engagement, and attention to causal mechanism; and (2) prototypes of SiMSAM for feedback.
