abstract: Recent work in science education has focused on the extent to which students are authentically engaged in disciplinary practices in the classroom, versus playing "the classroom game," (Lemke, 1990). We present data from a 10-hour science workshop with middle-school age participants in which we document the dynamics of participants' framing, a sense of "what is going on here" (MacLachlan & Reid, 1994; Tannen, 1993; Goffman, 1986). We argue that the learners and facilitators negotiatied and maintained a framing which was neither purely disciplinary nor "the classroom game", but instead was a productive hybrid. We present evidence that learners understood facilitators to be social authorities throughout the workshop, allowing them to define discussion topics, tasks, and objectives, while at the same time learners controlled key disciplinary practices such as developing coherent, mechanistic accounts of a physical phenomenon.
