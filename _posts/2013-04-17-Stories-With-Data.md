abstract: We explore middle school students' dynamic representational competence – competence with representations of quantitative situations that vary over time, or that utilize time as a representational dimension. Given the increasing importance of computational representation and complex systems in K-12 education, we explore across multiple representational media and task types. We analyze student artifacts and semi-clinical interviews to identify four core 'units' students use to construct and describe representations&#58; Setting, Object, Measure of Change, and Rules. These enable us to align and compare features of different normative, non-normative, and emerging representational systems, which we argue is important at a time when science and mathematics educators are increasingly interested in flexible modeling, data analysis, and systems thinking activities across the K-12 curriculum.
