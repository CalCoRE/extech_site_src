abstract: Computational media (visualizations, simulations, etc.) allow students to elaborate and test their scientific understandings in ways that may be difficult using only speech or drawing. We report on a multi-day workshop with five sixth-grade girls during which they constructed and critiqued models of smell diffusion using drawing, stop-motion animation, and computational simulation. We analyze video to identify shifts in their modeling practices and conceptual understandings over the course of the activity. We found&#58; (1) despite changes in media, the participants sustained their pursuit of a model of smell diffusion rather than starting over; (2) their model underwent cycles of conceptual elaboration, pruning, and encapsulation when transitioning across media; and (3) participants engaged in different modeling practices with different media.
