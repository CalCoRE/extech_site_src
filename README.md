extech_site_src
===============

Expressive Technologies jekyll site

This follows the standard jekyll format, except that I have the config set to run jekyll in 
the super directory to extech_site_src and output to a directory called extech_site.

I got the template for the site from html5up.com and heavily edited it to make it more [cannon pink](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#8C4563).

There are three layouts: project, post, and paper. 
In addition to having their specific page types, layouts correspond to other type-specific 
elements on the site:
Front page (posts and papers)
Research page (papers)
Projects page (projects...!)
Posts and papers pages also contains some project info
Posts and papers should be linked to projects whenever possible.

There are lots of hard links, because I can't get all the rel paths for the css to work.
Probably there is a better way to do that, but it can be fixed from the config file.
